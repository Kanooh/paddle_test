      <title>Madredeus</title>
      <link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madredeus</link>
      <description>Madredeus (Portuguese pronunciation: [maðɾɨˈðewʃ]) is a Portuguese musical ensemble. Their music
        combines traditional Portuguese music (which is sometimes erroneously associated with the subgenre of Fado) with
        influences of modern folk music. The lyrics are often melancholy, related to the sea or travelling or absence,
        continuing a tradition of songs dating back to Medieval times (with obvious connection to cantigas de amigo
        among others).

        Madredeus founding members were Pedro Ayres Magalhães (classical guitar), Rodrigo Leão (keyboard synthesizer),
        Francisco Ribeiro (cello), Gabriel Gomes (accordion) and Teresa Salgueiro (vocals). Magalhães and Leão formed
        the band in 1985, Ribeiro and Gomes joined in 1986. In search of a female singer, they found Teresa Salgueiro in
        one of Lisbon's night clubs. Teresa agreed to join and, in 1987, Madredeus recorded their first album, Os dias
        da Madredeus.

      <description>
        <b>t.A.T.u.</b>
        (Russian: Тату, pronounced [tɐˈtu] ( listen)) was a Russian music duo that consisted of Julia Volkova and Lena
        Katina. The duo was managed by Russian television producer Ivan Shapovalov while in the group Neposedi. The duo
        were signed to their own production company T.A. Music, following the split with Universal Music Russia, and
        their sub-labels Interscope Records and Neformat.

        The duo established their success with their debut single "All the Things She Said", which gained acclaim from
        music journalists and critics, who deemed it one of the best singles in the early 2000s. The video of the
        single, however generated controversy worldwide, showing the girls kissing in the rain in school uniforms. Along
        with the number-one single, the following songs "Not Gonna Get Us" and "All About Us" gained success and also
        charted at No. 1 on other contemporary music charts.

      <description>
        <b>Queen</b>
        are a British rock band formed in London in 1970, originally consisting of Freddie Mercury (lead vocals, piano),
        Brian May (guitar, vocals), John Deacon (bass guitar), and Roger Taylor (drums, vocals). Queen's earliest works
        were influenced by progressive rock, hard rock and heavy metal, but the band gradually ventured into more

        their music.

        greatest hits album, a four-piece Take That without Williams officially announced a 2006 reunion tour around the
        UK, entitled The Ultimate Tour. On 9 May 2006, it was announced that the group were set to record new material
        together once again; their fourth studio album, Beautiful World, was released in 2006 and was followed up with
        The Circus, in 2008. The group achieved new success as a four-piece, scoring a string of chart hits across the
        UK and Europe while taking the number of records sold to 45 million worldwide.
