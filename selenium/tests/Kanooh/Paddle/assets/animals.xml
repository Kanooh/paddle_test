      <title>Cat</title>
      <link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat</link>
      <description>The domestic cat (Felis catus or Felis silvestris catus) is a small, usually furry, domesticated, and
        carnivorous mammal. They are often called housecats when kept as an indoor pet or simply cats when there is no
        need to distinguish them from other felids and felines. Cats are often valued by humans for companionship and
        their ability to hunt pests.

        Cats are similar in anatomy to the other felids, with strong, flexible bodies, quick reflexes, sharp retractable
        claws, and teeth adapted to killing small prey. Cat senses fit a crepuscular and predatory ecological niche.
        Cats can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other
        small animals. They can see in near darkness. Like most other mammals, cats have poorer color vision and a
        better sense of smell than humans.

      <title>Dog</title>
      <link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog</link>
      <description>The domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris or Canis familiaris) is a domesticated canid which has been
        selectively bred for millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.

        Although initially thought to have originated as a manmade variant of an extant canid species (variously
        supposed as being the dhole, golden jackal, or gray wolf), extensive genetic studies undertaken during the 2010s
        indicate that dogs are descendants of a now extinct northern Eurasian canid which diverged from gray wolves
        40,000 years ago. Being the oldest domesticated animals, their long association with people has allowed dogs to
        be uniquely attuned to human behavior, as well as thrive on a starch-rich diet which would be inadequate for
        other canid species.

      <title>Blue whale</title>
      <link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_whale</link>
      <description>The blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus) is a marine mammal belonging to the baleen whales (Mysticeti).
        At 30 metres (98 ft) in length and 180 tonnes (200 short tons) or more in weight, it is the largest existing
        animal and the heaviest that has ever existed.

      <title>Sperm whale</title>
      <link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm_whale</link>
      <description>The sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus), or cachalot, is the largest of the toothed whales and the
        largest toothed predator. It is the only living member of genus Physeter, and one of three extant species in the
        sperm whale family, along with the pygmy sperm whale and dwarf sperm whale of the genus Kogia.

        Mature males average at 16 metres (52 ft) in length but some may reach 20.5 metres (67 ft), with the head
        representing up to one-third of the animal's length. The sperm whale feeds primarily on squid. Plunging to 2,250
        metres (7,380 ft) for prey, it is the second deepest diving mammal, following only the Cuvier's beaked whale.
        The sperm whale's clicking vocalization, a form of echolocation and communication, may be as loud as 230
        decibels (re 1 µPa at 1 m) underwater, making it the loudest sound produced by any animal. It has the largest
        brain of any animal on Earth, more than five times heavier than a human's. Sperm whales can live for more than
        60 years.

      <title>Armadillo</title>
      <link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armadillo</link>
      <description>Armadillos are New World placental mammals with a leathery armour shell. Dasypodidae is the only
        surviving family in the order Cingulata, part of the superorder Xenarthra, along with the anteaters and sloths.
        The word armadillo means "little armoured one" in Spanish. The Aztecs called them āyōtōchtli /aːjoːˈtoːt͡ʃt͡ɬi/,
        Nahuatl for “turtle-rabbit”: āyōtl /ˈaːjoːt͡ɬ/ (turtle) and tōchtli /ˈtoːt͡ʃt͡ɬi/ (rabbit).

        About 10 extant genera and 20 extant species of armadillo have been described, some of which are distinguished
        by the number of bands on their armour. Their average length is about 75 cm (30 in), including tail. The giant
        armadillo grows up to 150 cm (59 in) and weighs up to 54 kg (119 lb), while the pink fairy armadillo is a
        diminutive species, with an overall length of 13 to 15 cm (5 to 6 in). All species are native to the Americas,
        where they inhabit a variety of environments.

      <title>Sponge</title>
      <link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sponge</link>
      <description>Sponges are animals of the phylum Porifera (/pɒˈrɪfərə/; meaning "pore bearer"). They are
        multicellular organisms that have bodies full of pores and channels allowing water to circulate through them,
        consisting of jelly-like mesohyl sandwiched between two thin layers of cells. Sponges have unspecialized cells
        that can transform into other types and that often migrate between the main cell layers and the mesohyl in the
        process. Sponges do not have nervous, digestive or circulatory systems. Instead, most rely on maintaining a
        constant water flow through their bodies to obtain food and oxygen and to remove wastes.
