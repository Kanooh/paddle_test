================

This module opens up parts of the Drupal API so the site configuration can be
easily read and changed during automated browser testing.

Please note that this intentionally exposes internal data to the outside world,
so this is solely intended for use in controlled testing environments.

DO NOT, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES, EVER, ENABLE THIS ON A PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT.
