Paddle Content Region
=====================

Allows to create region presets globally, per content type and overrule them for
every specific page you want.

Log in and go to 'Structure' > 'Regions' to configure global content.

Edit your landing pages and add 'Global content' panes to whichever landing page
(region) you want.
